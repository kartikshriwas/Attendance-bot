# Registration Process
i was working on project for teachers which is releted to attendance, like automated attendance system which will reduce attendance load of teachers
firstly  i though to create an web application but after some time i thought to create a telegram bot where universities/collages have to resister then bot will provide them a unique id associated with that collage then each teacher have to resistor using that id so bot will know that teacher is from which university and each teacher and university registration required developer approval(verification) and then students also have to register using same collage id and everyone who is registering is required to shere their number for security purpose.

# Attendance System
class teacher have to create a telegram group and use setup command to setup everything then every lectures and students of that class have to join that group and when every prof is taking class they can start an attendance session with setting an unique id and also it will ask teacher for their current location, and when teacher done this attendance session will start and students have to attend their presenty using command and they also have to provide their current location and then bot will match teacher and student approximate location and if student is near teacher and they have entered that unique code provided by teacher correctly then their attendance will mark as present, and at the end teacher have to end their session and after that they will get a summary of students. and all useful info...
